# DD2360-project

This is the public repo for the final project for DD2360 Applied GPU Computing course at KTH.


Each dir contains source code for one situation in order for us to compare between different data precision. All are tested and ready to compile and run, just use 
```
make clean
make all
```

The `GPU_Project_performance.ipynb` file contains all the process and results evaluating performance boost of different data type combinations.
